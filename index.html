         <h2>Quick Summary</h2>

         <p class="background"> According to WikiPedia "Big Sur is a rugged stretch of California’s central
            coast between Carmel and San Simeon. Bordered to the east by the Santa Lucia Mountains and the west
            by the Pacific Ocean, it’s traversed by narrow, 2-lane State Route 1, known for winding turns,
            seaside cliffs and views of the often-misty coastline. The sparsely populated region has numerous
            state parks for hiking, camping and beachcombing." </p>

         <p class="dog">During several day hikes, the puppy (Abba) was feeling braved
            and wanted to climb some trees, while we supervised.

         <p class="dog">Clearly the puppy was incredibly helpful while we loaded up the car</p>

         <p class="dog">Abba is quite the photogenic dog and loves to pose for the camera</p>

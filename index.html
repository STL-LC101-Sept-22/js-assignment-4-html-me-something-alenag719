         <h2>Quick Summary</h2>

         <p class="background"> According to WikiPedia "Big Sur is a rugged stretch of California’s central
            coast between Carmel and San Simeon. Bordered to the east by the Santa Lucia Mountains and the west
            by the Pacific Ocean, it’s traversed by narrow, 2-lane State Route 1, known for winding turns,
            seaside cliffs and views of the often-misty coastline. The sparsely populated region has numerous
            state parks for hiking, camping and beachcombing." </p>

            and wanted to climb some trees, while we supervised.

            <p class="funParagraph">Big Sur has several campground that are available.
               Some of the campground had beautiful cabins but we opted out for camping in a tent.
               Big Lodge Sur was one of the bigger campground and has plenty of spots to pick from.
               Few things to remember about Big Sur: the bears are very real and cell service is nonexistent.
